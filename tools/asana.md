# Asana

Asana details the roadmap of each project and its respective tasks that are needed to be carried out. Asana allows us to organize our roadmaps in a clear and simple way which is used on a daily basis by all members of the studio.

## 1. How do we work with Asana?

### 1.1 Projects

For each project we use its id and name, to maintain consistency throughout all the tools we use.

```text
[Project id]_[Project Name]
```

For example, if we created a new project in Asana for our Playtomic project:

* Project id → 19
* Project name → Playtomic

19\_Playtomic

{% endhint %}

Each project has its own section which is as follows:

* **Boards**  They allow us to visualize tasks. 
* **Timeline**  The timeline represents the roadmap of a project. This roadmap is set up together with the client in the proposal. 
* **Calendar** 
* **Conversations** 
* **Progress**  Allows you to see which tasks have been completed and which remain to be done. 
* **Files**  Allows you to view all files attached to a given task.

### 1.2 Boards

The dashboard contains all tasks of a particular project. The tasks to be completed are defined at the beginning of a project and from there we continue to develop and supplement them as the project progresses.

A dashboard is made up of columns and tasks. The columns represent the status of a task. For us the tasks can have 5 different statuses: Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In progress, QA, Completed.

* **Backlog**

  At the beginning of a project, all the tasks associated with the functionalities and services contracted with the client in the proposal are added to Backlog.

  All new tasks that arise during the course of the project will be included in this column, to later be decided when they will be carried out.

* **Sprint Backlog** Every Monday, in the weekly Planning we meet with the whole team to specify which tasks will be completed for the upcoming week and define its scope of work.

* **In progress**

  In order to properly coordinate, it is very important that when a team member begins a certain task, he or she moves it to this column. This allows the rest of the team to see what tasks are currently being carried out.

* **QA**

  When a task is completed, it goes to QA so that it can be reviewed by the project leader.

* **Completed**

  This column contains all the tasks completed and reviewed by the project manager. This ensures that all tasks have been successfully completed.

### 1.3 Tasks

Each project breaks down the global tasks that correspond to the services and functionalities to be implemented. That is, each global task is broken down into smaller tasks that can then help us complete it.

For tasks to truly help our workflow, one must describe the action involved. We define tasks with actions.

An example would be, instead of having a task called “Design System”:

* Document Design System 
* Create Design System

This allows the person assigned the task to know what they have to do.

In addition to having a descriptive name, Asana allows us to detail the tasks with:

* **Name**
* **Description**

  The description allows us to include any necessary details so that anyone with no prior knowledge of the project can complete it.

  To give context to a task:

  * People or other tasks can be mentioned by @.
  * Include important links
  * Upload files

    If the deadline of a task is changed, we include in the description the reason for the change and the corresponding persons are then notified.

* **Project to which they belong**
* **Deadline**

  The deadline must be realistic and objective taking into account the objectives of the project, and the rest of the tasks that have been defined within the sprint.

* **Person in charge**

  Each task can only be assigned to one person. And all tasks must be linked to the person who is to complete them. It is the project leader who assigns the task to a member of the project.

* **Followers**

  As each task can only be assigned to one specific person, followers of the task are included when it involves several people. As a follower, you will receive updates when the status of a task changes.
