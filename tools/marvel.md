# Marvel

We use Marvel for rapid prototyping. It allows us to test and share our prototypes with ease.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To use Marvel directly from Sketch it is necessary to install [this plugin.](https://help.marvelapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/208594489-Sketch)
{% endhint %}

To organize projects in Marvel we use the following naming system:

```text
[Project id][Project name][File id][file type][Platform]_[Variation]
```

* The platform field is optional. It helps us to determine whether the content of the project pertains to a web project \(desktop or mobile\) or an app \(iOS or Android\).
* The variation field is optional. It serves to specify that it is going to be tested in a user flow.

For example, if a prototype is going to be tested at the navigation level, our project Fastti should be named like this:

Project id → 18   
Project name → FASTTI   
File id → 03   
File Type → UX   
Platform → Web-Desktop   
Variation → Navigation  


```text
18_FASTTI_03_UX_Web-Desktop_Navigation
```
